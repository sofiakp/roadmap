To Compute P-Values:

1) Compute mean signals: Pro_Enh_Dya.R 
2) Normalize the mean signals: Signal_Normalization.R
3) Compute correlations between each pair of signals: 	Pro_Enh_Dya_Correlations.R
4) Compute permutations for each pair of signals: Null_Hypothesis.R
5) Aggregate Correlations: Aggregate_Correlation.R
6) Compute P-Values: P_Value.R
