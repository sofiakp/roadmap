To Compute P-Values:

1) Compute mean signals: Pro_Enh_Dya.R 
2) Normalize the mean signals: Signal_Normalization.R
3) Compute correlations between each pair of signals: 	Pro_Enh_Dya_Correlations.R
4) Compute permutations for each pair of signals: Null_Hypothesis.R
5) Aggregate permutated correlations: Aggregate_Correlation.R
6) Compute P-Values: P_Value.R


To Compute overlaps between experimental data and computational data:

1) Build computational data file and experimental data file based on the correlated pairs of genes and enhancers: Enh_Gene_bedFile.py
2) Permute computational data file in terms of gene name column:  BedFile_Permutation.py
3) Intersect all the permutation files with experimental data file to find region overlaps: Intersect_BedFiles.sh
4) Count the number of overlaps based on gene names: Overlaps_Counts.py
